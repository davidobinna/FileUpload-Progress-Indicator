 When building a web app, we have to upload files on the server, so on web pages we can not check the file uploading progress, and it is very difficult for a user to check the file upload process. So at times the Progress bar or progress meter is very a useful feature, because it has reduce the issue of displaying multiple file upload process or progress on web page in graphical form. Because A Progress bar or Progress meter is a graphical element which has display live uploading progress on web page. So mainly Progress indicator has been used for display progress process in percentage format at the time when the upload or download or install any software is in use. i have made the progress indicator with JavaScript, Ajax and PHP script.
