** Progress Indicator For Upload and Downlod **
When building a web app, we have to upload files on the server, so on web pages we can not check the file uploading progress, and it is very difficult for a user to check the file upload process. So at times the Progress bar or progress meter is very a useful feature, because it has reduce the issue of displaying multiple file upload process or progress on web page in graphical form.
